            Electrical Engineering is a super interesting topic, and you can learn a lot of cool stuff by studying it,
        but instead of getting knee-deep into more abstract questions about the importance of Aluminum gallium arsenide,
        or what a Schottky diode is, what if you were able to solve all kinds of engineering problems just by applying a
        basic understanding of math, and remembering which equations to use and when? This is a sort of experiment to see
        how far it's possible to get into an advanced topic, with a rudementary understanding of the subject material.
